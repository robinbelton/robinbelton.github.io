<p>My research focuses on studying data using the information of a partial order.
I focus on two examples. The first is studying time series data based on the order of local extrema. This can help us compare different genomic time series. The second is studying directed paths in a Euclidean cubical complex that model concurrent programs. The directed paths provide us information about program executions. I construct, compute, and compare directed descriptors that capture the data in these two settings. I previously studied reconstructing plane graphs from persistence diagrams. While I was an undergraduate, I worked on projects involving medical images and genomic time series data.</p>
