<p>I am an applied mathematician with a deep interest in interdisciplinary applications and data science using topological and geometric techniques. My thesis work focused on constructions and comparisons of weighted directed graphs for representing multivariate time series data. These constructions use tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and have applications in biological network analysis. Additionally, I have been involved in projects concerning inverse problems in TDA and directed topology. I am interested in expanding my research expertise to include more techniques from machine learning and network science.
