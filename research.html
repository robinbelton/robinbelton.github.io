<p>My research interests are in data science using topological and geometric techniques. My current work focuses on time series analysis and data visualization using tools from topological data analysis (TDA), statistics, and machine learning. Most of my work is methodological or algorithmic, and some of my work has applications to biology and audio signal processing. Additionally, I have worked on problems in directed topology and inverse problems in TDA.
