I am passionate about teaching. My goal as an educator is to create an engaging and inclusive learning environment where success is accessible to all. In past semesters, I was a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) at Montana State University (MSU). I lectured, held office hours, and graded assignments in this role.

  <li> I created two videos for the Applied Algebraic Topology Research Network (AATRN) youtube channel. One on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR8nmASz3W8">creating mosaics from images</a> and another on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOG8DYq-EXY"> directed topology</a>. </li>
  <li> I was a grader and lead tutor for M151 (Pre-calculus) at MSU in Summer 2019. </li>
  <li> I was a teaching assistant at the Applied Mathematical Modeling with Topological Techniques Workshop at ICERM in August 2019. For this workshop, I created a <a href="https://comptag.github.io/rpackage_tutorials/2019/07/tda-rips-tutorial.html">Rips Filtration tutorial</a> for the R-TDA package.</li>
  
  <li> During the semesters I taught, I was also a mathematics tutor at MSU's Math Learning Center.</li>
  
  <li> While at Kenyon College, I was the lead tutor for Calculus II and the Art of Mathematics (non-major's course). </li>
</ul>
