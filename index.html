Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at Smith College. In July 2024, I will start a new position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Vassar College. My research interests are in topological data analysis (TDA), computational topology and geometry, network science, and mathematical biology. My pronouns are <em>she/her</em>.

    <li><b>October 2024</b>. I am on the organizing committee of the <a href = "https://shinstitute.org/the-broader-engagement-be-program/"> Broader Engagement (BE) Program</a> for the <a href= "https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/mds24">SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science</a>. Through the BE program, Liz Munch and I will be mentoring a Guided Affinity Group (GAG) on “Topology and Data”. Students in our GAG will meet with us each morning and attend sessions relevant to our topic. 
    <li><b>August 2024</b>. I am attending the <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/">Joint Statistical Meetings</a> and participating in the <a href="https://preparingtoteach.org/">Preparing to Teach workshop</a>.</li>
