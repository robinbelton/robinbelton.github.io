Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Vassar College. My research interests are in topological data analysis (TDA), computational topology and geometry, network science, and mathematical biology. I will be teaching statistics and data science classes. I also care about making the scientific community more welcoming and accessible, and contribute to various projects that focus on this.
