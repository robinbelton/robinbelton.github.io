<p> Hello! I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Montana State University (MSU). I was advised by <a href ="https://math.montana.edu/gedeon/"> Dr. Tomas Gedeon</a> and worked on problems in Applied Topology. Starting in July, I will be a postdoc at Smith College. My pronouns are <em>she/her</em>. </p>

<p> My research interests are in topological data analysis (TDA), computational topology and geometry, directed topology, network science, and mathematical biology. </p>
