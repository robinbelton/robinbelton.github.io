<ul>
    <li><b>February 2024</b>. Code for <em>G-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction</em> is now <a href = "https://github.com/MRC-Mapper/G-Mapper"> publicly available</a>. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. More details can be found in the <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06634">preprint</a>.
    <li><b>January 2024</b>. I am giving a talk at the <a href = "https://www.aatrn.net/seminar"> online seminar for the Applied Algebraic Topology Research Network (AATRN)</a>. A recording of the talk can be found on the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXJ1Tfvvs-M"> AATRN youtube channel</a>.
